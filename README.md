# RUW-Oil-Prediction

## Paper Demo Code

A deep learning approach for combining time-series and textual data for taxi demand prediction in event areas.

This code reproduces the experiments in the paper:
> Rodrigues, F. and Markou, I. and Pereira, F. C. Combining time-series and textual data for taxi demand prediction in event areas: a deep learning approach. In Information Fusion, Elsevier, 2018.

We made some slight modifications to the demo code to make it run.

## Goal: Predict Oil Prices with Time Series News Article Data
